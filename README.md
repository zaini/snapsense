# Setup & Installation üìÑ

This application requires setting up various environment and configuration files for all the services used to work correct.

1. Set up a MySQL database by following the instructions below.

2. In ```backend/config/config.json``` add the following config with your details and ensure it is in ```.gitignore```.

```
{
    "development": {
      "username": "dev",
      "password": "dev",
      "database": "database_development",
      "host": "127.0.0.1",
      "dialect": "mysql"
    },
    "test": {
      "username": "root",
      "password": null,
      "database": "database_test",
      "host": "127.0.0.1",
      "dialect": "mysql"
    },
    "production": {
      "username": "dev_user",
      "password": "dev_user",
      "database": "snapsense",
      "host": "yourhostIPgoeshere",
      "dialect": "mysql"
    }
  }
```

3. In the backend, add the following ```.env``` with your data, again ensuring it is also in the ```.gitignore```:

```
DATABASE_CONNECTION = 'yourhostIPgoeshere'
DATABASE_USERNAME = 'dev_user'
DATABASE_PASSWORD = 'dev_user'
DATABASE_SCHEMA = 'snapsense'
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 'YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY'
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = 'YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'
AWS_REGION = 'e.g. ap-south-1, get this from AWS'
```

TODO: consider moving all the config and env folders to the root of the project

# Database Instructions

Follow [this guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mysql-on-ubuntu-20-04) or something similar to set up a MySQL database. You may want to create a local test and development server and create the production one on AWS.

TODO Ayan: add more instructions for how to set this up on AWS

# Running Application

To run the frontend, ```cd frontend && npm start```

To run the backend, ```cd backend && npm start```

TODO consolidate this into a single package.json command later which covers the whole app.

# Testing

You can run the frontend tests by calling ```npm test```.
